# Analyzing-Customer-Churn-in-Power-BI
For subscription-based businesses, reducing customer churn is a top priority. I investigated a dataset from an example telecom company Databel and analyzed their churn rates.
This included finding the churn rate, figuring out why customers are churning at the rate they are, and how to reduce churn. 
I answered these questions by creating measures and calculated columns, while simultaneously creating eye-catching report pages.
I started with exploring the dataset and creating measures in Power BI to get a better understanding of why customers are churning.
I investigated churn patterns to understand more why customers are leaving Databel.
I then created dashboard-style pages and arranged them into stories, to share the results with stakeholders.
